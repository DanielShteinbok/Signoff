# Signoff: Empowering Employers with Controlled Web3 Interactions

## Problem Statement

Employers in the world of blockchain often find themselves in a predicament when dealing with decentralized applications (dApps). On one hand, their employees, such as traders, need to interact with these dApps regularly, making a wallet like Metamask an integral part of their job. However, this raises a critical question: how can an employer retain control over the access and use of these wallets when an employee departs from the company?

This issue goes beyond just access. Employers might want to limit certain types of transactions or interactions with specific smart contracts. The challenge lies in implementing these restrictions without infringing on the typical user experience for the employee.

## The Solution: Signoff

Signoff is an innovative Web3 solution designed to address this issue. It integrates a modified version of the MetaMask plugin with a backend server controlled by the employer. The employees never interact with a private key directly. Instead, the transactions they initiate are routed through this server, where they are signed and returned, maintaining the familiar Metamask-like experience for the employees.

Here's an overview of how Signoff would work:

1. An employee interacts with a dApp and generates a transaction, which is sent to the modified Metamask plugin.
2. The plugin forwards the transaction to the employer's server, accompanied by authentication information about the employee.
3. The server signs and stores the transaction, and then notifies the employee.
4. Finally, the server-based MetaMask wallet sends the signed transaction to the main Metamask, which then publishes it as it usually would.

## Added Features for Employer Control

Signoff provides an array of features that allow employers to manage transactions in a way that suits their needs:

- **Transaction Limitations**: Employers can set up restrictions on the total number of transactions over a certain period, such as monthly.
- **Manual Confirmation**: Employers have the option to either allow transactions to be signed automatically or require manual confirmation.
- **Employee Monitoring**: Employers can access a list of all their employees.
- **Transaction Tracking and Analytics**: Employers can view a list of transactions and obtain detailed statistics and insights for each employee.
